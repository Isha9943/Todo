It is a basic todo list, which help you to keep track of your remaining tasks. It is made using flask framework and python.

The functionalities that can be performed are

We can easily add task by clicking on the add task button and mentioning the task. The tasks are arranged in an order  based on the time when the task was added.
Two operations can be performed on the tasks which were added earlier to the list, we can either update that task or delete it depending on the use case.
